<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Mai Tran, a South Florida native with a passion for turning ideas into digital reality. My journey into web development began in high school
   with an Intro to Web Design class, where I first discovered the magic of coding. That spark led me to 4Geeks Academy, where I leveled up my skills 
   through their intensive coding bootcamp—proof
   that I thrive in fast-paced, challenging environments.
</p>

<p>By day, I'm a Detail-Oriented Product Lister at a luxury resale boutique in Boca Raton. My role is equal parts detective and storyteller: I research, 
  photograph, and meticulously document high-end items to create listings that bridge the gap between online shoppers and physical 
  products. Juggling inventory, customer requests, and front-end support has
  sharpened my ability to prioritize, multitask, and problem-solve—skills that translate seamlessly into coding.
</p>

<p>When I’m not optimizing listings or debugging code, you'll find me:</p>
