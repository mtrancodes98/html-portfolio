    <h1>The Best Movies According to Mai</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Jurrassic Park (1993)</h3>
    <p>The start of a franchise that felt fresh at the time and little did we all know it would become a household name.</p>
    <h3>Arrival (2016)</h3>
    <p>A movie I originally watched thinking it was homage to "The Arrival(1996)" but was met with a slow paced but suspensful story  about aliens
        who decied to park their ship on Earth and just ominously hover there. The world leaders come to an agrreement in terms of sending someone 
        out onto the ship to try and learn the alien language in hopes of communicating with them.

    <h3>Rise of The Planet of the Apes</h3>
    <p>A movie meant to be a sort of "reboot" of the classic "Planet of the Apes (1968)" which is inspired by the book wrttien by Pierre Boulle. someone
        would argue that it does not live up to the hype or intergirty of its predecessor but as an avid fan of the franchise who has watched
        and rewatched all of them but also read the books would beg to differ. It breathes a new more mdoern life to the franchise.
